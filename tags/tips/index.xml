Sometimes during analysis work, you need to group consecutive sequence of values into different &amp;ldquo;runs&amp;rdquo;, and calculate metrics for each run. For example:
Given a time series recording some entity&amp;rsquo;s state, you want to calculate on average, how long does an entity stay in a particular state.
