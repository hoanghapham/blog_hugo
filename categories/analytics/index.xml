Sometimes during analysis work, you need to group consecutive sequence of values into different &amp;ldquo;runs&amp;rdquo;, and calculate metrics for each run. For example:
Given a time series recording some entity&amp;rsquo;s state, you want to calculate on average, how long does an entity stay in a particular state. Or a more specific example: Given a series of event data of several users, you want to group the users' events into sessions with a session cut-off threshold of your choice Generate run-length ID with R If you are an R user, you may have heard of this kind of analysis.</description></item><item><title>Vietnam bombing history with data - Part 2: Rolling Thunder Operation</title><link>http://hoanghapham.github.io/posts/vietnam-bombing-history-p2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://hoanghapham.github.io/posts/vietnam-bombing-history-p2/</guid><description>You can read Part 1 here.
